##### Langchain Models  
The model component in LangChain is a crucial part of the framework designed to facilitate interactions with various language models and embedding models.  

Language Models take text as input and return text as output.  
Embedding models take text as input and give vectors as output.  

##### Language Models  
Language models are AI systems/models designed to process, generate, and understand natural language text.  

1. LLMs - General purpose models that are used for raw text generation. 
2. Chat Models - Language models that are specialized for conversational tasks. They take a sequence of messages as input and return chat messages as output.  

##### Temperature Parameter
Temperature is a parameter that controls the randomness of a language model's output. 

##### Open Source Models
Open source models are language models that are freely available AI models that can be downloaded, modified, finetuned, and deployed without restrictions from the provider.  
This allows full control and customization.
